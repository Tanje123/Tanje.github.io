    <h2>Important</h2>
    <a>When making use of this platform make sure to stay on the same internet connection on your mobile device,
        if you visit the website using a WiFi connection and switch from internet connection while completing an offer
        a payout will not be given out.

    <h2 >What is the difference between Easy and Normal offers?</h2>
    <a>Easy offers only require that the application needs to be downloaded and opened for a period of one minute,
    these offers are very easy to complete.
    <br><br>
    Normal offers require more than just downloading and opening the mobile application, an example of this would be
    downloading and achieving a certain level in the application to receive the payout. Normal offers are harder to complete that
    is why the payout is usually higher.
    </a>
    <h2 >Can I uninstall an application after I have completed an offer?</h2>
    <a>Yes it is up to you to keep or uninstall the application after that the offer has been completed.
    </a>
    <h2 >How can I request a payout?</h2>
    <a>From the profile page a payout can be requested, all of the available funds on day of the payment will be paid out to the user.
    </a>
    <h2 >No (new) offers are showing?</h2>
    <a>We are constantly working on getting  offers on the platform, however we cannot always guarantee that this will be the case.
        If it is possible try using a different mobile device.
    </a>
    <h2 >Can I complete the same offer multiple times?</h2>
    <a>No, a payout will only given out for each unique install. When the same offer is done twice only
        the payout for the first installation will be given out.
